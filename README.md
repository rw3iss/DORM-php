# Dorm
This is an early implementation of an independent web framework which allows one to design an object model (including relationships) for a given domain (through a built-in GUI and/or API), and automatically sets up all the facilities for CRUDing a given object, and automatically serves a REST API for any given object (customizable of course). 

NOTE:
-Currently in the works, not all above features are working yet.
-FURTHERMORE: the project is currently being moved to a Laravel plugin, so all of this codebase will be change for the most part, shortly.
